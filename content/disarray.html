<p>Disarray was a project of mine when I was a couple months into learning Luau and found out about TypeScript.</p>
<p>My goal was to build a small prototype of a top-down shooter using TypeScript. I achieved this goal within a few days - though it was certainly hard adjusting to using OOP-style methods within Lua, a typically procedural language.</p>
