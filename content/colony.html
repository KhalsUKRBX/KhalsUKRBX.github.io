<p>Inspired by games like Dwarf Fortress and RimWorld, Colony Survival is my current passion project on Roblox.</p>
<p>The brief of the game is that you are in control of your colony that has crash-landed on an alien planet, and as such your goal is to keep your colonists alive from the elements, AI raids and events.</p>
<p>After doing many hours of research into RimWorld and its systems, the game's foundations and underlying systems have been constructed in such a way that player-generated content (yes! <b>mods!</b>) will be possible in future with just a couple lines of code in a sandboxed modulescript.</p>

<p>There is too much code even as of current (about 4000 lines worth) to show all of it (in addition to the fact that I don't want to reveal too much of it :P), but there are a couple code samples below.</p>
