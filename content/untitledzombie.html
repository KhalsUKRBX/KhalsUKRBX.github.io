<p>Untitled Zombie game (certainly not its final name, lol) is a project made in Unity using C# that aims to be a top-down multiplayer zombie arcade shooter.</p>
<p>Me and a friend are working on it, with him being responsible mostly for the art side of things and a small amount of front-end programming, whilst I'm responsible for the network architecture and gameplay systems.</p>
<p>As of current it has integration with Epics Online Services (used for matchmaking, lobbies and inviting your friends).</p>
